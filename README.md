RxJavaRiddles
=========

This repository contains some riddles for RxJava to help you learn and master RxJava. There is an [accompanying medium article](https://medium.com/@vanniktech/riddling-your-way-to-master-rxjava-145d5de99b55) that gives some more information.

It is a fork from https://github.com/vanniktech/RxRiddles with a switch to Java8.

Each riddle is in a single file with mabe an accompanying unit test that will check your implementation.

The solutions (in Kotlin) to some riddles can be found at https://github.com/vanniktech/RxRiddles/tree/master/src/test/kotlin/com/vanniktech/rxriddles/solutions.

### Contributing

I'm very open to having some more riddles. Especially some complex common use cases. In case you want to contribute create an issue and let's talk.

I want every riddle to be unique and have as little duplication as possible while also having some actual real-world use case for each riddle in mind. Something you can relate to and hopefully use in your everyday life.
